"""Module name / short purpose.

Delete sections you don't need. Keep this docstring focused and truthful.

Purpose
- What this module does and what it does NOT do.
- Key invariants / assumptions.

Public API
- Main entry points (functions/classes) intended for other modules to import.
- Stability expectations (e.g., "internal/private", "public and stable").

Usage
- Typical usage patterns (short, runnable examples).
- If CLI-related, show how other code calls into it (not necessarily shell commands).

Inputs / Outputs
- Expected inputs, types, constraints.
- What gets printed to stdout vs stderr (if relevant).

Errors and exit codes
- Exceptions raised (and which are "user errors" vs "bugs").
- For CLI-facing modules: mapping to exit codes (if applicable).

Configuration
- Environment variables (e.g., MYCLI_*), config files, defaults.
- Where config is read from and precedence rules.

Performance / limits
- Any complexity notes, big-O, or known bottlenecks.

Security
- Handling of secrets, filesystem paths, command execution, input validation.

Notes
-----
- Links to related modules, design decisions, TODOs.
